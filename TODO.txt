TEST
. check display updates as expected on turn-off

FIX
. add file system browser
. run heating hotter for some initial period

TODO
. web
    . make look like lcd
. scheduler onscreen
. adjust target temp based on return temp
. boiler cycling based on outside temp
  curl 'https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=51.75413&longitude=-1.124867&hourly=temperature_2m&timezone=GMT&timeformat=unixtime&past_days=0&forecast_days=2' |jq -r '.hourly.temperature_2m[]'
  also base on return temp
. (outside) temp setback / weather query
. auto hotspot if no wifi
. mqtt
. proper web page
. ntp, syslog targets from dhcp
. watchdog timer

IGNORE wnf
. persist on-until time in rtc/flash (scheduler fixes)

TESTED
rtc integration
target temperature adjustment
temperature cycling
web server
pump/boiler icon colour
1h displayed as 1:60
pump stays blue after channels go off
fake temperatures
. web
        . need newline before Hot Water 1h
        . obey channel enabled flag
        . add control for enable
. why does pump run on when HW satisfied? (icon only)
. flash persistence
. timezone not in effect
. scheduler page does not render due to JS error
. littlefs fails to open/initialize every time
. save channel active setting in flash
scheduler
    scheduler does not save to flash
    scheduler js does not load from boiler
    initialiser to read from flash
    URL to set 15 minute slot
    scheduler method to set slot & save to flash
    scheduler to obey channel active flag
    copy-to-next button
    done button
    web page to set schedule with js for toggling
link to scheduler from front page
. copy to next Sat->Sun does not work
. crashes when using copy to next / switching day
. scheduler js should use one get not 96
    bulk load of daily schedule
    correct runtime if turn on in middle of HW cycle
    URL to adjust base warmup
    scheduler does not account for time slot already partially passed
    summertime heating cycling (30s every 10 mins)
    scheduler warmup set
    correctly detect heating if turn on <warmup before schedule
. why does web say heating satisfied + satisfiedON?
. web links ok after becoming relative
. stop button should inhibit scheduler until end of current cycle
. run scheduler at reboot
. sludge buster should not run if this channel active
    sludge buster will start @5 mins
    start manual timer to overlap with sludge buster
. check scheduler behaviour if channel ready running ( for < or > time)
. web page runtime/cooldown time should be hh:mm:ss not just /60
. sludge buster should not run if other channel active (should not leave channel on off/calls/satoff)
. check uptime
. sat output should record/report state even if no pin
. changing schedule should force reevaluation
