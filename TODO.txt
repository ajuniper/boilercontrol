TEST
. check ready pin behaviour states
. check that mainsdetect is happy with half wave from mid position setting

FIX
. web show more config values
. should boost during warmup consider flow/return temp?

TODO
. make web look like lcd
. scheduler onscreen
. adjust target temp based on return temp (what are the rules?  try to minimise flow based on ret+15?)
. auto hotspot if no wifi
. ntp, syslog targets from dhcp
. mqtt

IGNORE wnf
. persist on-until time in rtc/flash (scheduler fixes)
. run heating hotter for some initial period (do it manually via multi temp schedule)
# query param to avoid redirect on direct config change (new value in 302)
. watchdog timer (already there)
* target temp defaults to 0
# when web sets warm/hot, display should update
. save default config values

TESTED
rtc integration
target temperature adjustment
temperature cycling
web server
pump/boiler icon colour
1h displayed as 1:60
pump stays blue after channels go off
fake temperatures
. web
        . need newline before Hot Water 1h
        . obey channel enabled flag
        . add control for enable
. why does pump run on when HW satisfied? (icon only)
. flash persistence
. timezone not in effect
. scheduler page does not render due to JS error
. littlefs fails to open/initialize every time
. save channel active setting in flash
scheduler
    scheduler does not save to flash
    scheduler js does not load from boiler
    initialiser to read from flash
    URL to set 15 minute slot
    scheduler method to set slot & save to flash
    scheduler to obey channel active flag
    copy-to-next button
    done button
    web page to set schedule with js for toggling
link to scheduler from front page
. copy to next Sat->Sun does not work
. crashes when using copy to next / switching day
. scheduler js should use one get not 96
    bulk load of daily schedule
    correct runtime if turn on in middle of HW cycle
    URL to adjust base warmup
    scheduler does not account for time slot already partially passed
    summertime heating cycling (30s every 10 mins)
    scheduler warmup set
    correctly detect heating if turn on <warmup before schedule
. why does web say heating satisfied + satisfiedON?
. web links ok after becoming relative
. stop button should inhibit scheduler until end of current cycle
. run scheduler at reboot
. sludge buster should not run if this channel active
    sludge buster will start @5 mins
    start manual timer to overlap with sludge buster
. check scheduler behaviour if channel ready running ( for < or > time)
. web page runtime/cooldown time should be hh:mm:ss not just /60
. sludge buster should not run if other channel active (should not leave channel on off/calls/satoff)
. check uptime
. sat output should record/report state even if no pin
. changing schedule should force reevaluation
# temp labels
# invert touch screen coordinates if display_rotation=3
# target should be --- if boiler off
# fake temperatures
# mains sense inputs in reverse order
# relay outputs in wrong order
# cycle based on flow hysteresis + min cycle time
# config for boiler cycling
# config to disable tempreporter
display to show target temp
temperature fetching
. web rotate top table to show better on mobile
. test /configlist
. check display updates as expected on turn-off
# active does not load from config / save to config
# scheduler config names not documented
# schedule does not load from config / save to config (rejected by mycfg)
  (maybe try putData / getData or RLE)
# tempreporter remap config names too long
# scheduler config nodes name too long
# set full schedule to config causes segv (add printf)
. scheduler done link does not go back to home page
# lcd active does not save to config
. watchdog reboots when first starting - TR task - fixed?
. clock refresh flicker
# no clock until wifi joined
. rewire mains to boiler correctly
. relay #4 not working, LED not active
. all relays work
. if start hw then htg, htg relay does not fire
. test html pages
tempchannel to have multiple temps
        know which is in use - scheduler
        know which is in use - web
        know which is in use - display
        know temp for each
. sequence with delay boiler off, pump off, zv deactivate - not all changed in single pass, cannot deactivate zv before pump
  . test changes to sequence boiler and pump on
. weird syslog characters
. config value for 3s delay
. config for sludge buster
. test state info always present in web even if ch disabled
. if shorten schedule then need to recalculate
. if turn off during schedule then do not restart until next interval
. cycle based on return temp + min off time
. heating boost   bstThrsh(0)
. extend manual heating via web does not update target temp
tempchannel to have multiple temps
        scheduler to spot change in requested temp and adjust
. heating advance wuThrsh(12) wuScale(0) wuLimit(0)
. defer sludge if other channel is active
. heating extend  orThrsh(4) orScale(0) orLimit(0)
. when load schedule page, select current day
. refresh web page every 15s
. sludgebuster should run for shorter time than cooldown
. cooldown based on temperature
. cooltime != circtime, during circ do not check temperature
. config value for mains detect threshold
. boost temperature during warmup
. calibrate mains detectors
. adjustTimer to ignore small changes
. touch screen flaky - reflow header on LCD
. config value for mains detect INPUT_ON_MILLIS
