TEST
rtc integration
summertime heating cycling
scheduler
    scheduler thread
    initialiser to read from flash
    scheduler method to set slot & save to flash
    web page to set schedule with js for toggling
    URL to set 15 minute slot
    URL to adjust base warmup
    scheduler to obey channel active flag
    copy-to-next button

FIX
. flash persistence
. when activate from web page sometimes goes into cooldown
. need syslog when pump/boiler turned off
. timezone not in effect
. littlefs fails to open/initialize every time
. web
        . make look like lcd

TODO
. scheduler onscreen
. boiler cycling based on outside temp
. persist on-until time in rtc/flash (scheduler fixes)
. (outside) temp setback / weather query
. auto hotspot if no wifi
. mqtt
. proper web page
. ntp, syslog targets from dhcp
. watchdog timer

TESTED
target temperature adjustment
temperature cycling
web server
pump/boiler icon colour
1h displayed as 1:60
pump stays blue after channels go off
fake temperatures
. web
        . need newline before Hot Water 1h
        . obey channel enabled flag
        . add control for enable
. why does pump run on when HW satisfied? (icon only)
